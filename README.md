## Overview

The Financial_Agents project is a pioneering endeavor that aims to empower users in enhancing their financial well-being through an innovative agentic workflow.
Developed as part of the Google AI Hackathon, this project leverages advanced technologies, including Gemini LLM, to streamline financial management processes and provide personalized assistance to users.

## Goals

The primary objective of the Financial_Agents project is to create an intuitive and efficient workflow that enables users to make informed financial decisions.
By harnessing the capabilities of Gemini LLM, the project seeks to:

1. Enable users to pose queries regarding their finances in natural language.

2. Retrieve relevant data from a designated financial database.

3. Automate the extraction of pertinent information from email notifications issued by banking institutions.

4. Populate the financial database with essential transaction details, including price, date, entity, and service.

5. Facilitate seamless interaction between users and the financial system to foster financial literacy and responsibility.

## Scope and Context

The Financial_Agents project operates within the domain of financial management and artificial intelligence.
It addresses the growing need for streamlined and personalized financial assistance in an increasingly complex and data-driven landscape. Key aspects of the project's context and scope include:

- Financial Management Landscape: The project operates within the broader context of financial management, encompassing areas such as budgeting, expense tracking, investment management, and financial planning.

- Artificial Intelligence Integration: Leveraging advanced AI technologies, specifically Gemini LLM, the project aims to introduce intelligent automation and natural language understanding capabilities to enhance user interactions and decision-making processes.

- Email Notification Parsing: A significant component of the project involves parsing email notifications from banking institutions to extract essential transaction details. This process involves monitoring email servers, extracting relevant information, and populating a centralized financial database.

- User-Centric Approach: The project prioritizes user experience and aims to provide personalized financial assistance tailored to individual needs and preferences. Through conversational interfaces and data-driven insights, users can interact with the system in a seamless and intuitive manner.

- Scope: The scope of the project encompasses the development and implementation of a comprehensive agentic workflow that enables users to pose financial queries, receive relevant insights, and automate transaction data extraction and organization. It does not extend to specific banking systems integration or regulatory compliance aspects, which may vary depending on regional or institutional requirements.

By focusing on these key aspects, the Financial_Agents project aims to address critical challenges in financial management while providing users with the tools and insights needed to achieve their financial goals effectively.
